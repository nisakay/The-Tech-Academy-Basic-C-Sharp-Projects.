C# Projects 

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework 

Projects: 

• Car Insurance 
• Student Management

Car Insurance 
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued. 

Student Management
This is a data visualization application that is meant to store and display student names or information for management purposes. It is an MVC web application that utilizes Entity Framework 6 for data access and a Code First workflow. It is still a work in progress.
